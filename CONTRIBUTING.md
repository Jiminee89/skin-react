## Contribution Steps

Before writing any code, please submit a new issue to [GitHub](https://github.com/eBay/skin-react/issues). Or, if you want to work on an *existing* issue, please request to do so on the relevant ticket.

We **strongly** advise you to only begin working on issues that are assigned specifically to you and that are part of the upcoming milestone, otherwise your work may end up being in vain.

Here is a rough overview of steps required when contributing code to react-skin:

* GitHub team members must create a new branch in the skin-react repo. Non-team members should create their own fork.
* Push commit(s) to the upstream branch.
* Send pull request
* After the pull request has been merged, your issue branch should be immediately deleted (by yourself or admin)


## Versioning

skin-react follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org):

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
1. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
1. PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

To help guide your contribution into the right bucket, we provide more detailed insight into each type of change in the sections below.


## Style Guide

When contributing to skin-react, please bear the following guidelines in mind:

* Ensure all markup adheres to our [accessibility patterns](https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/)
* Please do not commit commented out code to production.
